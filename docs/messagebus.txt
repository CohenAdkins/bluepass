Message Bus
===========

The communication between the Bluepass frontend and backend takes place via the
JSON-RPC protocol.

Currently the protocol is not authenticated, which is OK in the default
configuration where a Unix domain socket with restricted permissions is used.
Protocol-level authentication and authorization should be added later.
