The most succesfull decisons that i feel i've taken during development

 * Using gevent instead of threads. There have been countless times that i
   asked myself: "is this safe against concurrency?" Almost always the answer
   was: "yes, under gevent it is, but had i used threads it would not have
   been".

 * Separating the frontend from the backend with a message bus. Greatly
   assisted in testability of the backend, and portability to other platforms'
   native UIs.

 * Using Python dictionaries for many objects instead of real Python objects.
   This greatly faciliated serialization via the different APIs (via JSON).
